**What Went Well**
1) Cursor was really helpful to load code on local devices for testing
2) Agents are supportive when walking through the github steps (branch, pull request, committing) for those that have never used it

**What Didn't Go Well**
1) We worked on items last minute because of other responsibilities


**What To Improve**
1) Start earlier
2) Have more refined feature documentation (could use agents to do so!)

**Action Items:**
