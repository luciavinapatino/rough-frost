**Lessons Learned**
1) We need to make sure we are slightly more clear with out story naming conventions. There were instances where some stories seemed to have overlapping features which made the division of work difficult
2) We need to take more time to do story points a little bit accurately. We did it based on vibes and having some type of framework could help to create a more standardized way to measure effort.

**Product Backlog Updates**
1) We would like to improve the UI and add some thematic elements or a name to create a brand image
