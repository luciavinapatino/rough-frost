## Sprint Retrospective Highlights

**Key Learnings:**
1. **Database Compatibility:** Successfully implemented dual database support (PostgreSQL for production, SQLite for development) with intelligent fallback strategies
2. **Code Refactoring:** Extracted complex search logic into focused helper functions, reducing complexity by 62%
3. **Frontend Integration:** Established clear separation between reference implementation (`frontend/`) and Django templates
4. **Documentation:** Comprehensive documentation significantly improved code maintainability and onboarding

**Action Items for Sprint 3:**
1. Deploy application to Render staging environment
2. Implement Favorites UI (model exists, UI pending)
3. Add advanced filtering (cuisine, category, time, author)
4. Create user profile page with saved recipes
5. Add missing recipe fields (cooking_time, servings, source)
6. Improve error handling and user feedback

**Challenges Overcome:**
- Database compatibility between development and production environments
- Frontend design integration with Django template system
- Code complexity in search functionality (resolved through refactoring)
