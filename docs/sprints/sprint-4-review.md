# Sprint 4 Review

## Completed Work
- **Image Functionality Fixes:** Resolved broken image rendering, added fallback logic, and standardized image handling across the app.
- **Recipe Upload MVP:** Implemented an initial scraper capable of inputting titles, ingredients, instructions, and images from multiple food blogs manually.
- **Image Extraction in Scraper:** Added automated image retrieval and validation for scraped recipes.
- **Analytics Page Iteration:** Added the first set of analytics features, including ingredient frequency insights and layout improvements.
- **UI Polish & Stability Improvements:** Cleaned up inconsistent components and added better loading/error states.
- **Bug Fixing & Reprioritization:** Reprioritized the backlog to address critical bugs that emerged mid-sprint.

## Work Not Completed
- **Advanced Analytics Features:** Additional visualizations and deeper insights were moved to a future sprint due to reprioritization.
- **Automated Scraper Support:** We would add a functionality to automatically extract the form fields from a blog using just the URL.
- **Performance Optimization for Scraping:** Optimization tasks were deferred to focus on stability and bug fixes.
- **Extended Image Processing Enhancements:** Edge-case handling (very large files, unsupported formats) will require further work.

## Overall Summary
Sprint 4 delivered key functionality necessary for project stability and user value, particularly around images.
