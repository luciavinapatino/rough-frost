## User Journey Demo

**1. Registration → Login → Recipe Creation:**
User creates account → automatically logged in → clicks "Create Recipe" → fills form with title, description, ingredients (dynamic add/remove), instructions (numbered steps), and optional image → recipe saved to database → redirected to detail page.

**2. Recipe Management:**
Logged-in user clicks "My Recipes" → sees grid of all recipes → clicks recipe card → views full details (ingredients, instructions, image) → can navigate back to list or homepage.

**3. Logout:**
User clicks "Log out" → session terminated → redirected to homepage with login/register options.

**Demo Highlights:** All flows functional and intuitive, clear error handling, dynamic form fields enhance UX, images display correctly, seamless navigation.

## Technical Progress

### What's Working Well
- **Authentication:** Django's built-in framework provides secure, reliable user management with seamless session handling
- **Data Model:** Well-structured models (Recipe, Ingredient, Step) with proper relationships, ImageField support, scalable design
- **Dynamic Forms:** JavaScript-powered ingredient/instruction fields with add/remove functionality, form validation
- **Code Quality:** 10 unit tests (100% pass), clean Django best practices, proper separation of concerns
- **Media Handling:** Image uploads working (file/URL), proper configuration, correct display

### Technical Challenges Remaining
1. **Image Storage:** Need cloud storage (S3/R2) for production (currently local)
2. **Code Review:** Need formal review process before PR merges
3. **User Testing:** Limited feedback during development; need early testing process
4. **Documentation:** Sprint 2 docs incomplete; need historical data
5. **Recipe CRUD:** Missing edit/delete functionality; prioritize for Sprint 4

## Sprint Retrospective Highlights

### Key Insights
**What Went Well:** (1) Successful authentication implementation, (2) Dynamic form UX, (3) Comprehensive test coverage, (4) Clean code organization, (5) Scalable database design

**What Didn't Go Well:** (1) Image upload config took more time than anticipated, (2) Sprint 2 documentation incomplete, (3) Limited user feedback during development

**What to Improve:** (1) Sprint planning & documentation (complete Sprint 2 review, establish template, include dependencies), (2) Development workflow (code reviews, weekly syncs, technical decision log), (3) User testing (create plan, identify test users, mid-sprint demos)

### Top Action Items
| Action | Owner | Deadline |
|--------|-------|----------|
| Complete Sprint 2 review | [Team Lead] | End Sprint 3 |
