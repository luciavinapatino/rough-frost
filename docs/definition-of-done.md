## Definition of Done (DoD)
User stories must meet these criteria before being marked as “Done” and potentially shippable.

A user story is Done when:
- Code is implemented, peer-reviewed, and merged into the main branch
- All unit and integration tests pass
- The feature is deployed to the staging environment
- Acceptance criteria are verified as met by QA or the Product Owner
- Documentation (technical and/or user-facing) is updated
- No critical bugs remain open
